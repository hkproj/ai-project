# Italian lipreading dataset

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to train a model to lipread the Italian language using a variety of speakers taken from the web. The primary source for the videos is the popular video sharing platfrom YouTube. Since it is not possible to share videos downloaded from YouTube without Alphabet's or the owner's permissions, the videos will not be shared, but rather, links to the videos and the timestamps to crop will be the main output of this dataset building process. Each researcher can use the pipeline to download its own copy of the videos to perform further processing.

### Video selection

Videos have been selected so as to bring as much variety as possible into the training data. This includes videos of males and females, videos of people with different skin tones and background. Videos where there is primarily one speaker whose face is fully visible have been preferred, as our goal is to catch the lip area in the video and map it to the corresponding text. Educational videos, self-help videos and videos in which there is one active speaker telling a story are more suitable for this task.
