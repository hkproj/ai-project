1
00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:00,481
E

2
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:00,722
diciamo

3
00:00:00,742 --> 00:00:00,842
che

4
00:00:00,862 --> 00:00:00,883
i

5
00:00:00,943 --> 00:00:01,364
risultati

6
00:00:01,424 --> 00:00:01,544
non

7
00:00:01,605 --> 00:00:01,765
sono

8
00:00:01,825 --> 00:00:01,966
poi

9
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:02,206
così

10
00:00:02,266 --> 00:00:02,848
positivi

11
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:03,390
se

12
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:03,590
quel

13
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,072
pattern

14
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:04,272
è

15
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:04,653
l'unico

16
00:00:04,693 --> 00:00:05,034
criterio

17
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,080
di

18
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,241
entrato.

19
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,120
È

20
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:06,241
vero

21
00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:06,341
che

22
00:00:06,461 --> 00:00:06,602
ogni

23
00:00:06,662 --> 00:00:06,963
candella

24
00:00:06,983 --> 00:00:07,324
racconta

25
00:00:07,364 --> 00:00:07,484
una

26
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:07,885
storia,

27
00:00:08,487 --> 00:00:08,567
ma

28
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:08,748
se

29
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:09,069
vogliamo

30
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:09,290
avere

31
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:09,350
il

32
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:09,671
quadro

33
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:10,212
completo

34
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:10,874
non

35
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,001
possiamo

36
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:11,162
basarci

37
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:11,262
solo

38
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:11,322
su

39
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:11,403
una

40
00:00:11,423 --> 00:00:11,543
storia.

41
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,121
Quindi,

42
00:00:13,402 --> 00:00:13,783
prendiamo

43
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:13,863
un

44
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:14,344
grafico

45
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:14,745
così

46
00:00:14,786 --> 00:00:15,006
riesco

47
00:00:15,026 --> 00:00:15,046
a

48
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:15,287
farmi

49
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:15,568
capire

50
00:00:15,628 --> 00:00:15,869
meglio.
