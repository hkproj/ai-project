12
00:00:04,843 --> 00:00:04,984
Sono

00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:06,952
diversa,

20
00:00:06,992 --> 00:00:07,173
come

21
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:07,434
erano

22
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,060
nel 1997,

23
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:07,221
quando

24
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:07,301
uno

25
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:07,522
cominciava

26
00:00:07,542 --> 00:00:07,562
a

27
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:07,703
vedere

28
00:00:07,723 --> 00:00:07,843
questi

29
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:08,084
pezzettini

30
00:00:08,104 --> 00:00:08,245
sparsi.

31
00:00:10,943 --> 00:00:11,164
Numero

32
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:11,565
quattro,

33
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:12,769
l'automazione.

34
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,291
L'automazione

35
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:13,652
succede

36
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:13,873
già

37
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:14,314
oggi,

38
00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:14,602
quindi

39
00:00:14,663 --> 00:00:15,084
immaginate

40
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:15,185
in

00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:15,586
futuro.

42
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:15,827
Voglio

43
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:15,988
dire,

44
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:16,088
se

45
00:00:16,108 --> 00:00:16,289
andate

46
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:16,349
in

48
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:17,201
a

49
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:17,542
Milano

50
00:00:17,562 --> 00:00:17,582
o

51
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:18,004
Roma,

52
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:18,325
stanno

53
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:19,068
sostituendo

54
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:19,209
i

55
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,651
controlli

56
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:19,791
del

57
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:20,534
passaporto

58
00:00:20,723 --> 00:00:20,863
con

59
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:20,964
le

60
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:21,647
macchinette.

61
00:00:21,787 --> 00:00:21,827
E

62
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:22,048
questo

63
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:22,590
significa

64
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:22,751
che

65
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:22,831
il

66
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:23,333
poliziotto

67
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:23,502
che

68
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:23,622
era

69
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:23,823
prima

70
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:23,863
a

71
00:00:23,884 --> 00:00:24,084
controlli

72
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:24,165
del

73
00:00:24,185 --> 00:00:24,767
passaporto,

74
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:25,169
quel

75
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,610
controllo

76
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:25,731
non

77
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:25,871
fa

78
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:26,012
più

79
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:26,984
direttamente.

80
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:27,124
Una

81
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:27,506
macchina

82
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:27,707
ha

83
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:28,390
sostituito

84
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:28,490
un

85
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:28,731
lavoro

86
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:28,831
di

87
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:28,932
un

88
00:00:28,972 --> 00:00:29,293
umano.

89
00:00:29,442 --> 00:00:29,582
Poi

90
00:00:29,683 --> 00:00:29,803
puoi

91
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:30,024
dire

92
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:30,406
meglio

93
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:30,727
così

94
00:00:30,807 --> 00:00:31,068
perché

95
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:31,209
era

96
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:31,289
un

97
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:31,912
lavoraggio,

98
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:32,032
ok?

99
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:32,421
Però

100
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:32,682
devi

101
00:00:32,722 --> 00:00:33,084
pensare

102
00:00:33,104 --> 00:00:33,184
che

103
00:00:33,204 --> 00:00:33,244
il

104
00:00:33,264 --> 00:00:33,505
lavoro

105
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:33,605
si

106
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:33,645
è

107
00:00:33,686 --> 00:00:33,766
già

108
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:34,027
sposto.
