1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,241
Però

2
00:00:00,261 --> 00:00:00,401
era

3
00:00:00,421 --> 00:00:00,461
un

4
00:00:00,481 --> 00:00:00,742
prodotto

5
00:00:00,762 --> 00:00:01,263
interessante

6
00:00:01,303 --> 00:00:01,484
perché

7
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:01,584
si

8
00:00:01,624 --> 00:00:01,965
potevano

9
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:02,286
cambiare

10
00:00:02,306 --> 00:00:02,326
i

11
00:00:02,366 --> 00:00:02,687
moduli,

12
00:00:02,747 --> 00:00:02,807
si

13
00:00:02,847 --> 00:00:03,148
poteva

14
00:00:03,188 --> 00:00:03,409
anche

15
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:04,030
sostituire

16
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:04,591
la

17
00:00:04,632 --> 00:00:05,093
batteria

18
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:05,273
e

19
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:05,454
qui

20
00:00:05,514 --> 00:00:05,594
vi

21
00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:05,915
voglio.

22
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:06,501
Perché

23
00:00:06,581 --> 00:00:06,762
oggi

24
00:00:06,802 --> 00:00:07,082
parliamo

25
00:00:07,123 --> 00:00:07,323
proprio

26
00:00:07,363 --> 00:00:07,443
di

27
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:07,944
batterie

28
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:08,746
rimovibili

29
00:00:09,087 --> 00:00:09,167
che

30
00:00:09,207 --> 00:00:09,528
potrebbero

31
00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:10,149
effettivamente

32
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,791
tornare

33
00:00:11,172 --> 00:00:11,372
sugli

34
00:00:11,432 --> 00:00:11,893
smartphone

35
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:12,114
come

36
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:12,234
era

37
00:00:12,274 --> 00:00:12,354
una

38
00:00:12,395 --> 00:00:12,675
volta

39
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:13,361
e

40
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:13,461
il

41
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:13,662
fatto

42
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:13,762
di

43
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:14,063
creare

44
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:14,223
uno

46
00:00:14,704 --> 00:00:15,105
modulare

47
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:15,425
potrebbe

48
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:15,646
essere

49
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:16,047
una

50
00:00:16,107 --> 00:00:16,327
delle

51
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:16,788
tante

52
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:17,850
interpretazioni

53
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:18,311
ad

54
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:18,472
una

55
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:18,852
nuova

56
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:19,333
norma

57
00:00:19,494 --> 00:00:19,594
che

58
00:00:19,634 --> 00:00:19,814
l'Ue

59
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:20,015
sta

60
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:20,476
vagliando.

61
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:20,540
In

62
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:20,941
realtà

63
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:21,001
la

64
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:21,301

65
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:21,342
è

66
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:21,422
già

67
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:21,662
andata

68
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:21,983
parecchio

69
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:22,303
avanti,

70
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:22,524
quindi

71
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:22,804
manca

72
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:23,325
l'approvazione

73
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:23,866
definitiva

74
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:24,427
che

75
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:24,988
obbligherebbe

76
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:25,028
i

77
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:25,309
propri

78
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:25,890
produttori

79
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:26,511
adottare

80
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:26,651
gli

81
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:27,272

00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:29,436
rimovibili

85
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:30,361
facilmente

86
00:00:30,442 --> 00:00:31,003
sostituibili

87
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:31,824
dagli

88
00:00:31,844 --> 00:00:32,205
utenti.

89
00:00:32,485 --> 00:00:32,546
Vi

90
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:32,746
dico

91
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:33,026
tutto.
