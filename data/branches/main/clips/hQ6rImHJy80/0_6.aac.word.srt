00:00:12,886 --> 00:00:13,308
vedremo

39
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:13,869
perché

40
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:14,411

49
00:00:17,146 --> 00:00:17,487

60
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:21,645
completamente,

61
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:22,026
aumentare

62
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:22,067

produzione

67
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:23,490
che

68
00:00:24,813 --> 00:00:24,893

73
00:00:26,724 --> 00:00:26,864
Però

74
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:27,305
ecco,

75
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:27,546
se

76
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:27,847
questa

77
00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:28,188

78
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:28,871
andasse

79
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:29,312

87
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:32,169
Vediamo

88
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:32,510
alcuni
