00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:40,192
tratti

101
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:41,723
zero

102
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:42,747
non

schifezze

110
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:45,083
altrimenti

111
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:45,363
sarebbe

112
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:45,845

00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:46,928
controproducente

115
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:47,369
e

116
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:47,609
quindi
